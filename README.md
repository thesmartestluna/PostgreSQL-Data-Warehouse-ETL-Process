# PostgreSQL-Data-Warehouse-ETL-Process
<h4> In this project, I designed and built a data warehouse with dimensional modeling and ETL(Extract, Transfrom, Load) process with PostgreSQL and Pentaho. </h4>
<p> First, I set up the table structure and schema in the database management system. Then I designed staging for fact tables and dimension tables. Afterwards, I set up the core layer for the fact and dimension tables. Finally, I put things together, set up jobs and did testing. </p>
